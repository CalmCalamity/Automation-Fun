Random automation tests

I will add more test to this list as I think of them. Everything here uses Selenium.


Current Tests

**GoogleSearchTest**: Super basic test. Googles a phase then checks how many times that phrase appears in the search results.

**DealOfTheDayTest**: Checks the featured on sale item for a game store and how much it is on sale.

**MathQuizTest**: Opens a math quiz of a random type and answers questions for a minute. No math was harmed during the making of this test.


Possible Ideas
A test to take a Harry Potter which house are you quiz and guarrentee it picks a house randomly chosen at the start of the test
Redo some of the Petsmart_Solo_Project tests in java selenium
